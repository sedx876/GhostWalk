        Dread Central’s Own Staci Layne Wilson to 
        Direct Slasher Film DEAD SLATE</h3>
        <div>

            <p class="card-text">We're incredibly proud 
            and excited to hear that our own Staci Layne 
            Wilson has been locked down as the director 
            of the upcoming slasher Dead Slate, from 
            Ghost Walk Studios & 333 Productions! The 
            film, which is produced and written by Kerry 
            Fleming (Rock Paper Dead), will be entering 
            production in Spring of 2019 and will be 
            represented at this year’s AFM. 
            <br/><br/>
            Fleming states, “We’re thrilled to have 
            such a gifted talent as Staci come on board. 
            There has been so much talk recently to 
            the perceived scarcity of female directors 
            out there, which we do not agree with, so 
            we feel extremely fortunate to have 
            someone of Staci’s caliber agree to take 
            the helm for Dead Slate.”
            <br/><br/>
​            The current cast includes Max Wasa 
            (Death House), Brooke Lewis (iMurders), 
            John Dugan (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), 
            and Anna Margaret (Rock Paper Dead), as 
            well as Shanda Renee, Raelynn Harper, and 
            Luke Gregory Crosby.
            <br/><br/>
​           “Dead Slate takes you behind the scenes 
           of a slasher film production and follows 
           the stereotypical cast as they are stalked 
           by a masked psychopath who slays in homage 
           to classic cinematic murder set pieces.“</p>
